# CNN_voice_recognition_resistors
This MATLAB project calculates resistor values using voice recognition to identify the colors of the bands. It leverages MFCCs for audio feature extraction and a pre-trained neural network for color classification. The project also includes functionalities for displaying corresponding resistor images.
